# Commodity Price Forecasting using CATS

#### This repository applies the Cross-Attention Only Time Series transformer (CATS) to commodity price forecasting, benchmarking against ARIMA and Autoformer models. Based on the original CATS implementation from [Are Self-Attentions Effective for Time Series Forecasting?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16877)

## Research Overview

This study explores the effectiveness of modern deep learning approaches (specifically CATS) compared to classical WS-ARIMA and advanced transformers like Autoformer in forecasting commodity prices over long-term horizons. While ARIMA models are widely used in financial forecasting, they have limitations in handling long-term forecasts and capturing non-linear patterns. This research evaluates whether CATS can better capture the complex dynamics of commodity markets.

### Key Contributions:
- First empirical study of CATS on commodity price forecasting
- Comprehensive evaluation using complex, industrial-standard financial datasets
- Rigorous benchmarking against ARIMA (industry standard) and Autoformer
- Analysis of model performance on data with heavy non-stationarity & structural breaks

## Original CATS Architecture

#### ⚡ Cross-Attention Only Time Series transformer

CATS removes self-attention and retains only cross-attention in its transformer architecture. This design choice aims to better preserve temporal information in time series forecasting, addressing the potential loss of such information during the embedding process in traditional transformer models.

#### ⚡ Time and Memory Efficiency

CATS achieves improved time and memory efficiency compared to traditional self-attention-based transformers. While self-attention complexity grows quadratically with input length $$(O(L^2))$$, CATS' cross-attention-only approach scales linearly $$(O(LT))$$.

#### ⚡ Enhanced Parameter Sharing

CATS implements extensive parameter sharing across all layers and dimensions for each horizon-dependent query. This approach, including shared projection layers, significantly reduces parameter count and improves computational efficiency in both training and inference phases.


## Efficiency of CATS

We conducted extensive experiments to compare CATS with other state-of-the-art models for long input sequences. Our results demonstrate that CATS outperforms existing models in both efficiency and effectiveness.

### Performance Across Various Input Lengths

CATS maintains robust performance as input length increases, unlike some complex models that suffer from increased computational burdens.

### Handling Significantly Longer Sequences

We pushed CATS further by testing it with significantly longer input sequences (2880 time steps) and compared it to other models using shorter inputs (512 time steps). The results were remarkable:

- CATS demonstrated better efficiency in terms of parameters, running time, and memory usage, even when processing nearly 5 times more data.
- It achieved this while maintaining superior forecasting performance.

## Understanding Periodic Patterns with Cross-Attention

To better understand how CATS processes time series data, we visualized its cross-attention mechanisms. We used a simple time series composed of two independent signals with different periodicities (where $\tau = 24$, $S = 8$, and $k = 5$).

These maps reveal CATS' ability to capture both shocks and periodicities in the signal:
- The left score map shows higher attention scores for patches containing shocks in the same direction.
- The right score map clearly demonstrates the correlation over 24 steps, reflecting the model's capture of signal periodicity.

This visualization confirms CATS' effectiveness in leveraging periodic information for accurate predictions.


## Forecasting Results

CATS demonstrates superior performance across most datasets and forecasting horizons. CATS shows competitive results, often achieving the best or second-best scores in various time series forecasting tasks.
